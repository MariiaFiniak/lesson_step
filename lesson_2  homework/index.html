				<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<br> In fair Verona, where we lay
						our scene, <br>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br> Where civil
						blood makes civil hands unclean. <br>
						From forth the fatal loins of these two foes <br> A pair of star-cross'd
						lovers take their life;<br>
						Whose misadventured piteous overthrows <br>
						Do with their death bury their parents' strife. <br>
						The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love, <br> And the continuance
						of their parents' rage, <br> Which, but their children's end, nought could
						remove,<br>
						Is now the two hours traffic of our stage;<br>
						The which if you with patient ears attend,<br> What here shall miss, our
						toil shall strive to mend. </p>

							<h2 class="title_2">What is HTML?</h2>
							<div class="text">
								<p>
									<b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) </b>is the standard markup language
									for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="text">
								<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
									storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
									describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
									included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="text">
								<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
									constructs, images and other objects
									such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. H. ML
									provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural
									semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
									and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
									angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and â€¹input /> directly introduce
									content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide
										information about document text and may include other tags as
										sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to
										interpret the content of the page.</p>
								</div>
								<h2 class="title_2">Markup</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="text">
								<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those
									called
									tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character
									references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs
									like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are
									unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start
									tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags
									and closing tags).</p>
								<p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration,
									which triggers standards mode rendering</p>
								<p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!"
									program:</p>
